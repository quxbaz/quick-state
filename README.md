# quick-state
Simple immutable state management library.

In a sentence, `quick-state` provides a `store` object that can be updated
through something very similar to a React `setState` function.

Like Redux, `quick-state` is essentially an _interface_ to an immutable state
object. The best way to understand it at a glance is to compare it to Redux. See
the [comparison with Redux](#Comparison-with-Redux) section.
