# quick-state
Simple immutable state management library.

Like Redux, `quick-state` is essentially an _interface_ to an immutable state
object. The best way to understand it is to compare it to Redux. See the
[comparison with Redux](#Comparison-with-Redux) section.

In a sentence, it provides a `store` object that can be updated with something
simlar to a `setState` function.
